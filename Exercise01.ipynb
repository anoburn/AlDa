    "# Stable Glasses (12 Pts.)\n",
    "Glases in pubs are prone to breaking. Therefore, more stable glasses are being developed. To evaluate the stability of a new kind of glas, the following experiment is being done: Platforms that allow a controlled fall of a glass can be attached to a 3 m high stand with possible platform positions every 10 cm. The goal of this experiment is to find the highest possible fall height for a glass not to shatter with as few tries as possible. One try is defined as one fall of a glass off a platform. Another constraint is the number of available glasses which means only a certain amount of glasses may break.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do you determine the height of fall in case only one glass is at hand? How many tries are needed at most (explain). From an algorithmic standpoint, this is the worst case, for pubs the best case.\n",
    "1. It is possible to use fewer tries to reach the goal if more glasses may break. What is the process in this case, how many tries are needed at most and how many glasses are broken at most?\n",
    "1. A compromise is to allow two glasses to break. Which process minimizes the number of tries in the worst case scenario in this test case and how many tries will be needed in the worst case? (Hint: less than 15)\n",
    "1. Generalize your result from 3. s.t. the stand has `n` possible platform position. The process remains the same but the number of tries in the worst case is now a function `worst_case(n)`. Determine the function! Since the the number of tries is aways an integer, the function is a step function: The results for certain intervals may be the same until it increases by one only to be constant again for a few more steps. For `n=30`, the result should be the same as in 3."

    "1. To determine the maximum height the platform is moved up 10 cm per experiment, starting at the lowest position. This would mean a total of 30 tries at maximum, because the glass will never break.\n",
    "2. Divide and conquer approach, halving the possible heights after each test. At the beginning the minimum height is 0 m maximum height is 3 m. (ceiling while testing) Test if the glass breaks at minheight + maxheight / 2. If it does maxheight = maxheight / 2. If it doesnt minheight = maxheight / 2. repeat. The maximum number of tries are 5. The maximum number of glasses that would be broken this way are 5 (e. g. if the glass already breaks at 10 cm)\n",
    "3. For this case we combine both previous ideas into one algorithm. At first an adjusted divide and conquer method is used until the first glass breaks. From that point on we use the first method to make sure we find the correct height while only breaking one more glass. Instead of halving like before we now divide the remaining range by its sqrt, because if the glass doesn't break we can divide the upper remainder again, saving a lot of trials, but if it does break we want the lower remainder to be as small as possible. The sqrt is a surprisingly nice way to divide the remaining range. (Thanks import statement)"
