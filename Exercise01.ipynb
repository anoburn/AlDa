    "Glases in pubs are prone to breaking. Therefore, more stable glasses are being developed. To evaluate the stability of a new kind of glas, the following experiment is being done: Platforms that allow a controlled fall of a glass can be attached to a 3 m high stand with possible platform positions every 10 cm. The goal of this experiment is to find the highest possible fall height for a glass not to shatter with as few tries as possible. One try is defined as one fall of a glass off a platform. Another constraint is the number of available glasses which means only a certain amount of glasses may break.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do you determine the height of fall in case only one glass is at hand? How many tries are needed at most (explain). From an algorithmic standpoint, this is the worst case, for pubs the best case.\n",
    "1. It is possible to use fewer tries to reach the goal if more glasses may break. What is the process in this case, how many tries are needed at most and how many glasses are broken at most?\n",
    "1. A compromise is to allow two glasses to break. Which process minimizes the number of tries in the worst case scenario in this test case and how many tries will be needed in the worst case? (Hint: less than 15)\n",
    "1. Generalize your result from 3. s.t. the stand has `n` possible platform position. The process remains the same but the number of tries in the worst case is now a function `worst_case(n)`. Determine the function! Since the the number of tries is aways an integer, the function is a step function: The results for certain intervals may be the same until it increases by one only to be constant again for a few more steps. For `n=30`, the result should be the same as in 3."
